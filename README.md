Deep Neural Network Models for COVID-19 diagnosis from CT-Scan, while using the Trained Models for Explainability and Analysis

The world is going through a severe viral pandemic
caused by the Novel Coronavirus, also known as “COVID-19”.
People infected with this virus, experience severe respiratory
illness. The virus spreads through particles of saliva or droplets
from an infected patient’s nostril. There are ways of identifying
COVID-19 based on the symptoms such as fever, dry cough,
tiredness, but these symptoms are similar to other existing viral or
respiratory infections. There is no quick approach to diagnosing
if a patient is infected by the virus or not. To overcome the
drawbacks mentioned above a faster diagnosis is needed which
leads us to the objective of this study, which is to construct
a diagnostic approach that uses pre-existing data mostly on
COVID-19, as well as take datasets from other respiratory
diseases. We will apply deep learning models to the acquired
datasets enabling us to obtain more accurate and efficient
results. We aim to use Deep Neural Network models namely
convolutional neural network models (CNN) such as VGG19,
Inception v3, MobileNetV2, and ResNet-50. These four models
are pre-trained and they classify the CT-Scan images based on
the trained learning approaches. The result of each model is
compared among the models to get faster and more accurate
results. This paper also proposes a ”Hybrid” model which is
composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and Support
Vector Machine (SVM). The Hybrid Model is shallow and just
as accurate as the pre-trained models. Based on the accuracy of
the outcome and the least amount of time required for image
classification we will be able to diagnose more accurately and
effectively.
